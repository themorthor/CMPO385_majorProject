# CMPO385_majorProject

INSTRUCTIONS FOR OBSCURITY:

Note: This code is originally intended for top-down projection as an art installation, using touch-sensitive laced curtains. The code may also suit an alternative and experimental synthesizer medium.
      Please see the included Arduino script for use with a touch-sensitive teensy 

The code will automatically open in setup mode. You can do the following within this mode:
- While holding a letter key, click and drag to assign a trigger box to said key.
- While hovering over a trigger box (and it is highlighted red), click and drag to move the box. (drag slowly, so as to not exit the hitbox)
- While hovering over the top left corner of a trigger box (and a green circle has appeared), click and drag to resize the box. (drag slowly, so as to not exit the hitbox)
- While focused on the canvas, press OPT (option) to enter full-screen mode.
- If you wish to download a .json file of your configuration, press RETURN (enter).
- If you wish to upload a .json file of your configuration, use the file upload in the top left of the canvas.
- When you are ready to exit setup mode, pres CONTROL.

When in "run" mode, the code will automatically begin generating audio. You can now use any keys previously assigned to make boxes fade in on the canvas. 
There are events that happen when you begin to press and hold more keys.
To reset the code, please restart the program.
